## The List™️

The List™️ contains all official Yogscast YouTube channels, as well as any unofficial clip / compilation channels!

It updates once a day (see [how it works](#how-it-works)), [add any missing channels](#adding-channel) (or [ask me to](mailto:jake@jakelee.co.uk)). Tap a column's header to sort by that field.

## How it works

### Updating

This list updates once per day with the latest stats for each channel. Full details [are available here](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/fetching-youtube-metadata-in-github-actions-and-persisting/).

### Adding channel

To add a channel, edit [`channels.txt`](https://github.com/JakeSteam/Yogscast/blob/main/automation/channels.txt) to include the channel ID and channel name:
* Channel ID can be retrieved from a profile at `About` -> `Share` -> `Copy channel ID`
* Channel name is not used, except to make the file more readable.
